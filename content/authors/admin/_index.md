I am Md. Motahar Mahtab, an AI Engineer and Applied Researcher with 3+ years of experience designing, training, and deploying intelligent systems across \textbf{NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Multimodal AI}. With a strong academic foundation (\textbf{CGPA 3.99}) and publications in top-tier venues (\textbf{NAACL, EMNLP}), I specialize in bridging research innovation with scalable engineering. My work spans building \textbf{multi-agent LLM pipelines}, \textbf{SOTA NLP models}, and \textbf{vision-driven information extraction systems}, along with architecting high-performance MLOps infrastructures leveraging \textbf{TensorRT, Triton, Kubernetes, and KEDA}. Passionate about developing efficient, reliable, and explainable AI systems that generalize across domains and modalities.
